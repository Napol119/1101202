Lab #1 - Google Dorking

0. Lab Objectives
	
At the end of Google Dorking lab exercise, you should be able to:
•	Understand what Google Dorking is and what it is used for
•	Explain how Google Dorking works
•	Issue appropriate Google Dorks for finding required information
1. Introduction
	For those who are interested in cyber security, one of the first questions they ask is usually “how should I start learning how to hack?”  A simple and straightforward answer to this would be “Google.”  Why?  Because Google is something we are all familiar with already.  I am sure you know what Google does.  Yes … We all use Google for searching for information.  The question is “how do we use it in the context of cyber security?”

	Google Dorking will be the answer.  Google Dorking is also known as Google Hacking.  However, as you have already learned in my lecture, Google hacking is NOT hacking Google.  What we will do is we will just use Google as a tool to help us find information we want in order to begin “hacking.” 

2. History

	It all began in 2002 when a person named Johny Long started collecting interesting Google search queries that provided him with sensitive and confidential information as well as vulnerabilities of information systems.  He then named these queries Google Dorks.

	Johny Long, as a professional hacker, suggested that using Google was a simple and non-technical way to uncover necessary information that could be used as a starting point to hacking which could then be exploited further.  What Johny was trying to say is that Google is thought of as a tool that helps find text, images and videos etc.  However, in the context of cyber security, it becomes a useful hacking tool.

	Saying that, it is not possible to hack or exploit a Web site or a computer system directly using Google.  What Google does for us is that it has the capabilities of crawling and gathering vast amount of information, a lot of which is sensitive and confidential.  This is how and why it is useful in the cyber security perspective.

3. What can be found using Google Dorks?

	We have already established that Google Dorks are search queries that uses one or more Google’s advanced search techniques.  By issuing the queries, it is possible that interesting and sensitive information will be revealed.  Examples of data that can be found using Google Dorks include:
•	Usernames and passwords
•	Sensitive documents
•	Personal information
•	Credit card and bank details
•	Digital certi	ficates and private keys
•	Live Web camera streaming
•	Government budget information
•	A lot more …
4. Examples of Google Dorks

	As already mentioned, Google Dorks are basically Google search operators, basic and advanced.  We will, therefore, begin with examples of these operators and how they function.
Operators	Description	Example
link	This will list Web pages that have links to the specified Web page.	link:google.com
site	This will limit the search to the specified site only.	site:sut.ac.th
intitle	Google will return the pages that have the specified term in their title.	intitle:downloads
inurl	Google will return the pages that have the specified term in their URL.	inurl:home.php
filetype	Google will search for the specified filetype.	filetype:pdf
ext	Ext is file extension, so it is similar to filetype.	ext:pdf
intext	This will search for the content of the pages.  Almost the same as normal Google search.	intext:cybersecurity
allintext	Similar to intext, but will search for more than one specified term.	allintext:security network book
*	A wild card character that can be substituted by anything.	site:*.ac.th

























5. Putting Google Dorks into Practice

	Now that we have seen some Google Dorks, let us put them into real usage.  What we have here are ten scenarios, starting from easy and going to more complex.  Your task is to:
	(1) State a Google dork command for each one,
	(2) Show a screen of your search results, and
	(3) Show a capture of examples of something interesting.

Task 1 - Finding pdf files 
My Google Dork Command is: [1 Mark]	
My screen of search results looks like this: [1 Mark]





















This is something interesting that I found: [1 Mark]

























Task 2 - Finding pdf files on Thai government Web pages
My Google Dork Command is: [1 Mark]	
My screen of search results looks like this: [1 Mark]





















This is something interesting that I found: [1 Mark]

































Task 3 - Finding budget files of types pdf and Excel
My Google Dork Command is: [1 Mark]	
My screen of search results looks like this: [1 Mark]





















This is something interesting that I found: [1 Mark]

































Task 4 - Finding budget files of types pdf and Excel on Thai government Web pages
My Google Dork Command is: [1 Mark]	
My screen of search results looks like this: [1 Mark]





















This is something interesting that I found: [1 Mark]

































Task 5 - Finding passwords that are listed in Excel
My Google Dork Command is: [1 Mark]	
My screen of search results looks like this: [1 Mark]





















This is something interesting that I found: [1 Mark]

































Task 6 - Finding passwords that are listed in Excel on Thai Web pages
My Google Dork Command is: [1 Mark]	
My screen of search results looks like this: [1 Mark]





















This is something interesting that I found: [1 Mark]

































Task 7 - Finding passwords or login credentials in log files
My Google Dork Command is: [1 Mark]	
My screen of search results looks like this: [1 Mark]





















This is something interesting that I found: [1 Mark]

































Task 8 - Finding passwords or login credentials in log files on Thai universities’ Web pages
My Google Dork Command is: [2 Marks]	
My screen of search results looks like this: [1 Mark]





















This is something interesting that I found: [1 Mark]
































Task 9 - Finding usernames with a specific domain such as @gmail.com or @yahoo.com or @something.go.th or @something.ac.th and their passwords in Excel files
My Google Dork Command is: [2 Marks]	
My screen of search results looks like this: [1 Mark]





















This is something interesting that I found: [1 Mark]
































Task 10 - Finding a directory of a Web site that contains sensitive information
My Google Dork Command is: [2 Marks]	
My screen of search results looks like this: [1 Mark]





















This is something interesting that I found: [1 Mark]

































6. What else can Google Dorks be useful for?

	We have already seen that we can use Google Dorks to find interesting information.  In an attacker’s perspective, the obtained information can be valuable.  How about using Google Dorks in your perspective, as someone who looks after a system or a network?

	If you were a security analyst or a person taking care of a system or a network, what would you use Google Dorks for?  How would you use it?  Give an example.

If you were a security analyst or a person taking care of a system or a network, what would you use Google Dorks for? [1 Mark]











Give an example of a Google Dork command that you might use to achieve your goal. [1 Mark]





 	At the end of this lab exercise, you should be able to understand and use simple Google Dorks to find interesting information.
